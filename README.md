### What I learned

This project was my first try at typeScript and i learned the basics of typeScript. Additionally, i also learned how to use scss and react beautiful dnd for drag and drop.

### Continued development

I plan to focus on react native so i can build mobile apps that can work on both android and iOS devices. Also i intend to learn useReducer hooks

### Useful resources

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - This helped me to understand variable types in typescript. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJDVKeh7RJI&t=3356s) - This is an amazing video, it also helped to enhance my understanding of working with typescript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
